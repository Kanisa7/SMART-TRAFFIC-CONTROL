# SMART-TRAFFIC-CONTROL
Description: Smart Traffic Control using AI is an intelligent traffic management system designed to improve traffic flow, safety, and efficiency on roads. The system utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for real-time monitoring and analysis of traffic conditions. 
Modules:
Object Detection:
This module employs computer vision algorithms to detect various objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists on the road.
It utilizes deep learning models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) for accurate and efficient object detection.
Speed Detection:
The speed detection module calculates the speed of vehicles by analyzing their movement between consecutive frames captured by surveillance cameras.
It uses optical flow or other motion tracking algorithms to estimate vehicle velocities and identify speeding violations.
Counting and Tracking:
This module counts the number of vehicles passing through specific road segments and tracks their movement over time.
It employs object tracking algorithms such as Kalman filters to maintain the continuity of object trajectories.
Number Plate Detection:
The number plate detection module extracts and recognizes vehicle license plates from captured images or video streams.
It utilizes image processing techniques and optical character recognition (OCR) to accurately identify alphanumeric characters on license plates.

This project aims to contribute to the development of smart cities by providing an intelligent solution for managing urban traffic more effectively, reducing congestion, and enhancing overall road safety.
